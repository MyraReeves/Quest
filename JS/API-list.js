Instructions:       https://docs.zenquotes.io/zenquotes-documentation/

https://zenquotes.io/api/[mode]/[key]?option1=value&option2=value
[mode] = Retrieval type [quotes, today, author, random]. REQUIRED.
[key] = **OPTIONAL**  API key for use with premium subscriptions
[options] = **OPTIONAL**  Additional options

Instructions for How to Fetch Quotes for your Website or App ( https://zenquotes.io/api/quotes/[your_key] ):
    "This is the most efficient way for developers to load random quotes. Use the standard [quotes] API call and store the results as a variable in your project. This will keep a cache of quotes that you can loop locally rather than calling the server each time you want to display a new quote.

    After a set interval (an hour or so), call the ZenQuotes API again to refresh your local app cache. Using this method will keep load times down and free up resources for others as your user base increases. In the event the API service is unavailable, you will still have an available data set in your app to pull from."
