# üßù A Hero's Quest üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This was the final JavaScript project for the first of three JavaScript courses within earning the _**Full-Stack Development With JavaScript**_ certificate from the University of Washington.

Graded: December 2024

## üìú Assignment

> _Your project must be interactive (i.e. must have event listeners).  The user must be able to interact with the document with the mouse or keyboard and have the document change / update._
>
> _Your project must include 4 of the 6 following features (but may include more):_
>
> * _One or more Classes (must use static methods and/or prototype methods)_
> * _Testable code (using Jasmine unit tests)_
> * _One or more timing functions_
> * _Form fields_
> * _One or more fetch requests to a 3rd party API_ 
> * _Set/update/change local storage._

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Features

1. **Timing functions**
    * When the user starts the game, they are presented with a welcome text introducing them to the plot of the game.  This text (above the character creation form) appears on the screen letter-by-letter using CSS.  The animation code I used would have revealed all paragraphs in a screen-high, vertical, left-to-right transition wipe fashion.  So I used a timed delay for the addition of each new paragraph to the DOM, that way letters in the next paragraph would not begin to appear until after the last word in the previous paragraph had finished appearing.

    * The project deadline prevented me from being able to implement the same CSS effect with the storyline narration that appears on later pages, but in the future I would like to do so.

    * After the user creates a character and begins the game, an unseen timer starts.  Once that timer reaches zero, a function is called.  Currently, that function ends gameplay with a "To Be Continued..." screen.  In the future, I would like it to add a timer that involves finding an item or performing a task, and if the item has not been found (or task has not been completed) before the timer reaches zero, then the player loses the game.

2. **Contains form fields, validates those fields**
    * When the user starts the game, they are asked to fill out a character creation form.
    * Name and Race are required fields via HTML constraint validation.

3. **Classes / Objects**
    * The information selected by the user within the character creation form is inputed into a prototype Character class.  A PlayerCharacter object with more specific attributes is then created using a race-specific "extends" class that inherits from the parent prototype.  NPCs are created during the course of the game using the same group of child extension classes.

4. **Third party APIs**
    * During gameplay, information is fetched from the following free API provider websites:
      * [Deck of Cards](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/)
      * [HTTP Status Dogs](https://http.dog/)
      * [NASA Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)
    * And the following widget:
      * [Weather Widget](https://weatherwidget.org/)

    * As is visible in the AP-list.js file, in the future I would like to also use [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Zen Quotes API](https://zenquotes.io/), but I ran into complications that couldn't be overcome before the project deadline.  So they were left out for now.

5. Testable code
